## Homework requirement link: https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/22319/assignments/614880
Implement the class hierarchy that you specified in Part 1. Create a class that represents a conservatory that houses many different types of birds. The conservatory is broken into various aviaries. This new class should:

Allow you to rescue new birds and bring them into your conservatory.

Calculate what food needs to be kept and in what quantities.

Assign a bird to a given aviary in the conservatory. Assignments must follow the following criteria:

There is a maximum of 20 aviaries in the conservatory.

Any bird can be inserted into an empty aviary.

No aviary can house more than 5 birds.

No extinct birds can be added to an aviary.

Flightless birds, birds of prey, and waterfowl should not be mixed with other bird types.

Allow a guest to look up which aviary a bird is in.

Produce text for any given aviary that gives a description of the birds it houses and any interesting information that it may have about that animal.

Produce a “directory” that lists all the aviaries by location and the birds they house.

Produce an index that lists all birds in the conservatory in alphabetical order and their location.

Create a driver class with a main method that creates a conservatory, adds some birds to it and prints the resulting directory and index. This method should serve as a lightweight demo; it should not be a comprehensive test of your conservatory.
